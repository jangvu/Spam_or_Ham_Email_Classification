# Spam_or_Ham_Email_Classification
Spam emails are unwanted emails share in bulk intending to gather data/ do phishing/ perform social engineering/ start an attack and a lot more – mostly for bad causes.
In this small project, I will try to classify the spam or ham email by using the data from Kaggle.

1. Preprocessing Data

There is a imbalanced in the training data, in order to solve this problem. A downsampling function is used to balance the amount of training data between spam and ham label

One-hot Encoding is used to reduce the computational cost, in which
* 1 – If a category is a ham/ not spam
* 0 – if the category is spam

2. Transfer-learning BERT

There are 2 main components: bert_preprocessor and bert_encoder, and both of them are pretrained.

As a generic step in the model building, we will now compile our model using adam as our optimizer and binary_crossentropy as our loss function. /For metrics, we will use accuracy, precession, recall, and loss.

3. Evaluation and Prediction
